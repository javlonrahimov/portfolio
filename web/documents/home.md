## About

Hi, I'm Javlon, and I'm a passionate Android mobile and Golang backend developer.

I have been programming for 2 years now, and I have completed many interesting and challenging projects, from commercial
apps that is used by thousands, to pet projects that inspire people to learn astronomy.

Apart from programming I enjoy playing ping-pong and chess as a hobby.
